## Protein Drug Interactions
This function takes in the protein name as a string, then reads in said protein from the protein database. It performs the chainA and b atom analysis, then plots it if the plot flag is set to true (which is its default state.)
```{r}
library(bio3d)
analyze_protein <- function(protein_name, plot=TRUE)
{
  p <- read.pdb(protein_name)
  p.chainA <- trim.pdb(p, chain="A", elety="CA")
  p.b <- p.chainA$atom$b
  if (plot)
  {
    plotb3(p.b, sse=p.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
  }
}
```
Calling the function is simple; just pass in the protein.
```{r}
analyze_protein("3RGK")
```
