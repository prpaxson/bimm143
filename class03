Section 1
Q1: I found that most of the coverage was ~99%, with a very low E value

Q2: There are more results with lower alignment statistics when increasing the Expect Threshold

Section 2
Q3: Yes

Q4: Found a few new strains of myoglobin, which is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles

Q5: It found a new kind of hemoglobin, and still found myoglobin and neuroglobin. In order to find even more distant results, one could dincrease the expect thresholdd.

Q6: Pos 144-146 - MVL

Q7: Much fewer results, only 25 vs ~250 from NCBI

Q8: Yes; 3RGK, 1OJ6, 4MPM

Q9: Very fast, much faster than NCBI. Was responsive

Q10: Holding the structure of the protein together
