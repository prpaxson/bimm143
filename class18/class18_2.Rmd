## Step 1
Identifying sequence regions that contain all 9-mer peptides that are only found in the tumor

First, we need to read in the sequences
```{r}
library(bio3d)
seqs <- read.fasta("lecture18_sequences.fa")
seqs
```

Now, we need to get all the mutation sites:
```{r}
mutations = c()
for (i in 1:(length(seqs$ali)/2))
{
  if ((seqs$ali["P53_wt",i] != seqs$ali["P53_mutant",i]) && (seqs$ali["P53_mutant",i] != "-"))
  {
    mutations <- c(mutations, i)
  }
}
```

Which are:
```{r}
mutations
```

But in order to get the 9-mers, we need to take ranges of -8 to +8 centered around these mutation sites:
```{r}

for (i in mutations):
  
```
